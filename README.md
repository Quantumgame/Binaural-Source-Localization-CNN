**Abstract:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification system was designed for the task of source localization of human voices in 3-D space. A new dataset, VoiceBin100K, is introduced to accomplish this task and for future work in the field. The CNN inputs variable-length binaurual short- time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitude and phase features and predicts location of the speakerâ€™s voice according to 168 location classes.
